					<p>Recchan, a high school girl with a monster face is popular among her classmates, yet what they believe is pity for her only ends in her disliking. The student council president however sees otherwise, finding jealousy and personal morals to differentiate her view on how to treat the girl with a monster face. Yet what others may see as a subjectively wrong view of the girl, refusing to care because of pity, only serves as a positive outcome.
